This is a website for Alkafest 2015, an annual student-led art and music festival in Al-Azhar Kelapa Gading high school.

## Background

Back in 2015, I was part of the Alkafest committee. At first, I was part of the design team, designing the logo, flyer, and ticket for the event. Later on, the head of the committee decided to make a website to promote the event. As the only one with web development knowledge, I was tasked to create the website. I started developing the website in November 2015 and finished a month after. The website includes an e-ticket system and database. It successfuly attracted 300+ visitors from outside the school.

## What I Used

**Foundation**

For the front-end, I used Foundation 5 to create a responsive mobile-friendly website. Mobile-friendly is the key to the success of this website given that the target audience, high school students, use phones most of the time to access the internet.

**PHP**

PHP handles all the back-end of this website. When the user ordered a ticket, they will be given a randomized unique ticket number. The committee of Alkafest can look up this number for information and grant the user entry to the event.

**MySQL**

The school IT department helped me to create and host a MySQL database. The database stored the user's information (name, email), ticket number, and whether or not the ticket has been used yet or not.

**Swift Mailer**

Swift Mailer is a PHP library to send emails. After submitting a ticket order, the user will receive an email with the ticket code to be shown at the event's ticket booth.
